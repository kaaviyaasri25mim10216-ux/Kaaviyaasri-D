# Tic tac toe 
##  Problem Statement
A very simple yet strategic game, Tic-Tac-Toe is played between two players on a 3×3 grid. Traditionally played on paper, its digital version ensures better interaction, error-free gameplay, automatic result evaluation, and replay options.
This project aims to develop a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe application where two players play against each other; the system can handle turns automatically, validate the moves, and automatically check the win/draw conditions.

--------------------

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is the implementation of a fully functional version of Tic-Tac-Toe with:
A 3×3 game board represented using a data structure.
Player X plays against player O, taking turns.
User input validation, for example, not overwriting an already occupied cell.
Automated detection of winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.
Draw condition detection by automation.
Clear display of the board status after each move.
To restart the game after finishing it.
Modular code structuring for readability and maintainability.

---------------------------

## Target Users
Students learning basic concepts of programming.
Arrays, conditions, and loops practice for beginners.
Anyone who wants to play a simple 2-player game on a computer terminal.
Developers interested in extending this project for GUI or AI versions.

-----------------------------------------

## High-Level Features
Two-player local gameplay - X vs O
Smarter move validation
Auto-detection of win, loss, and draw
Clean and structured board display Replay option Modular, easy-to-understand code  Error handling for invalid inputs
